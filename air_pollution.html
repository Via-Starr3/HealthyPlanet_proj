                    <h2>What is air pollution?</h2>
                    <p>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutants in
                        the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage
                        to the climate or to materials. It is also the contamination of the indoor or outdoor
                        environment either by chemical, physical, or biological agents that alters the natural features
                        of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including
                        ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons),
                        particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause
                        diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms
                        such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change,
                        ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air
                        pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>So, basically air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any
                        chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the
                        atmosphere.</p>

                    <h2>Why is it happening?</h2>
                    <p>Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common
                        sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter,
                        carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution
                        cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. </p>

                    <h2>What can we do to help?</h2>
                    <p>WHO promotes interventions and initiatives for healthy sectoral policies (including energy,
                        transport, housing, urban development and electrification of health-care facilities), addressing
                        key risks to health from air pollution indoors and outdoors, and contributing to achieving
                        health co-benefits from climate change mitigation policies. </p>
