                    <h2>What is water pollution?</h2>
                    <p>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a
                        stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and
                        rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. Unsafe water kills more
                        people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Meanwhile, our drinkable
                        water sources are finite: Less than 1 percent of the earth’s freshwater is actually accessible
                        to us. Without action, the challenges will only increase by 2050, when global demand for
                        freshwater is expected to be one-third greater than it is now.</p>

                    <h2>Why is it happening?</h2>
                    <p>Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to
                        dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and
                        brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from
                        farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.</p>

                    <h2>What can we do to prevent it?</h2>
                    <p>Learn about the unique qualities of water where you live, reduce your plastic consumption and
                        reuse or recycle plastic when you can, properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and
                        nonbiodegradable items to keep them from going down the drain, maintain your car so it doesn’t
                        leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant, be mindful of anything you pour into storm sewers, since that
                        waste often won’t be treated before being released into local waterways. If you notice a storm
                        sewer blocked by litter, clean it up to keep that trash out of the water (You’ll also help
                        prevent troublesome street floods in a heavy storm), don’t flush your old medications! Dispose
                        of
                        them in the trash to prevent them from entering local waterways.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>One of the most effective ways to stand up for our waters is to speak out in support of the Clean
                        Water Act, which has helped hold polluters accountable for five decades—despite attempts by
                        destructive industries to gut its authority. But we also need regulations that keep pace with
                        modern-day challenges, including microplastics, PFAS, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants
                        our wastewater treatment plants weren’t built to handle, not to mention polluted water that’s
                        dumped untreated.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>So much you can do, right? Don't forget to care about your planet!</p>
