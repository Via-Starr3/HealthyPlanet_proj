                    <h2>So, what is soil pollution?</h2>
                    <p>Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by
                        the
                        presence of human-made chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment.
                        It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of
                        waste
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>So, basically, soil pollution is a pollution of the ground we're walking on with chemicals.
                        Usually
                        it
                        happens because of industrial emissions. Not every factory care enough not to dispose of toxic
                        waste
                        in ecological way.</p>

                    <h2>What is dangerous about it?</h2>
                    <p>Contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with soil or
                        via
                        inhalation of soil contaminants that have vaporized; potentially greater threats are posed by
                        the
                        infiltration of soil contamination into groundwater aquifers used for human consumption,
                        sometimes
                        in areas apparently far removed from any apparent source of above-ground contamination. Toxic
                        metals
                        can also make their way up the food chain through plants that reside in soils containing high
                        concentrations of heavy metals. This tends to result in the development of pollution-related
                        diseases.</p>

                <h2>What causes soil contamination?</h2>
                <p>Pesticides and herbicides.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A pesticide is a substance used to kill a pest. A pesticide may be a chemical substance, biological
                    agent (such as a virus or bacteria), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest.
                    Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes
                    (roundworms) and microbes that compete with humans for food, destroy property, spread or are a
                    vector for disease or cause a nuisance. Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, there
                    are also drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other organisms.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Herbicides are used to kill weeds, especially on pavements and railways. They are similar to auxins
                    and most are biodegradable by soil bacteria. However, one group derived from trinitrotoluene have
                    the impurity dioxin, which is very toxic and causes fatality even in low
                    concentrations. Another herbicide is Paraquat. It is highly toxic but it rapidly degrades in soil
                    due to the action of bacteria and does not kill soil fauna</p>
                <p>Insecticides are used to rid farms of pests which damage crops. The insects damage not only standing
                    crops but also stored ones and in the tropics it is reckoned that one third of the total production
                    is lost during food storage. As with fungicides, the first insecticides used in the nineteenth
                    century were inorganic e.g. Paris Green and other compounds of arsenic. Nicotine has also been used
                    since 1690.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Also, The disposal of munitions, and a lack of care in manufacture of munitions caused by the urgency
                    of production, can contaminate soil for extended periods. There is little published evidence on this
                    type of contamination largely because of restrictions placed by governments of many countries on the
                    publication of material related to war effort. However, mustard gas stored during World War II has
                    contaminated some sites for up to 50 years and the testing of Anthrax as a potential biological
                    weapon contaminated the whole island of Gruinard.</p>

                    <h2>What can we do to prevent it?</h2>
                    <p>Use of correct farming techniques,
                        recycling of waste before disposal, recycle and reuse products,
                        use of organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers and pesticides,
                        community education and awareness, get the locals involved
                        proper maintenance of sewage system, proper disposal method of household and industrial waste,
                        reforestation and afforestation should be promoted,
                        planting new trees and plants is afforestation.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>We live because plants live. If the plants die,
                        all living things will also die. Thus, whenever trees are cut down new trees should be planted.
                        Planting trees in hilly areas are most effective for conservation.</p>
                    <p></p>
